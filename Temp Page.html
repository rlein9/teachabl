    <h2>About Teachabl</h2>
    <p>We are a new Edtech startup looking to revolutionize the way that teachers
      search for, gather, and collate materials for usage in their classrooms.</p>
    <p>We believe that it can be difficult to find currated, and well organized materials for the classroom.
      <br>Many websites are disorganized and it can be difficult to find the exact materials you need.
      <br>We want to revolutionize this process and make searching for and gathering materials easier for the average teacher
      <br>The founder has experience working in a classroom as a science teacher, and found that it can be difficult to find
      <br>the materials you need for your classrom. </p>
